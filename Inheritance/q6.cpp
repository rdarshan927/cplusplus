/*
All the banks operating in India are controlled by RBI. RBI has set a well defined guideline (e.g. minimum interest rate, minimum balance allowed, 
maximum withdrawal limit etc) which all banks must follow. For example, suppose RBI has set minimum interest rate applicable to a saving bank 
account to be 4% annually; however, banks are free to use 4% interest rate or to set any rates above it.

Write a program to implement bank functionality in the above scenario. Note: Create few classes namely Customer, Account, RBI (Base Class) and 
few derived classes (SBI, ICICI, PNB etc). Assume and implement required member variables and functions in each class.
